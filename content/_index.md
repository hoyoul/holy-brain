I am [holy frege](https://frege2godel.me). My real name is Hoyoul Park and from Korea. I had a time when I really liked the German mathematician G. Frege, so I combined my English name 'holy' with 'Frege'. This braindump displays my org files written in Emacs, where I jot down my thoughts whenever they come to mind, in a web format. The technologies used here include the ninja tool and makefile for incremental build, and an elisp code for converting org to HTML, although it has many limitations, so I used ox-hugo. In other words, the conversion process used was org -> md -> html. The search feature uses local storage and indexing in the browser to perform searches on the notes. The graph is a force-directed graph using d3. There are many things to be modified and improved, but it is designed for personal use and viewing on a PC, so it may be inconvenient on a mobile device. It is not difficult to implement responsive web design, but I chose not to use it. For inquiries or suggestions regarding the source code, please contact the email address below. By the way, I also have a GitHub address
